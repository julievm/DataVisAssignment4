The plane crashed into Trinity Bay and broke apart in muddy water about 5 feet deep. The probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode. which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captain’s failure to adequately monitor the airplane’s flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industry’s selection and performance measurement practices. which failed to address the first officer’s aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration’s failure to implement the pilot records database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.
2019,09/Mar,1040,Vereda La Bendicion.

2019,10/Mar,844,Bishoftu. Ethiopia,Ethiopian Airlines,302,Addis Ababa - Nairobi,Boeing 737 Max 8,ET-AVJ,149,8,149,8,0,The internationally scheduled airliner crashed 6 minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa-Bole Airport. The pilot sent out a distress call and was given clearance to return to the airport. The crash site. some 31 miles southeast of the airport. contained a smoky crater with small pieces of wreckage. When the 737 Max 8 was designed. it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this. the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this. not the pilots or airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude. it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane. the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude. but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane’s stall speed was reached. and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem.

About 16-21nm west of Sheremetyevo Airport there was a thunderstorm. The aircraft was climbing through 7.900 feet when an electrical failure occurred. the flight control system degraded to ""DIRECT MODE"". the autopilot automatically disconnected, the aircraft was in the middle of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft until the end of the flight. The crew decided to return to Sheremetyevo and performed a manual ILS approach to runway 24L. At the time the aircraft intercepted the glideslope the aircraft’s mass was above the maximum landing weight. The crew deployed the flaps to 25 degrees in accordance with the flight crew operating manual for flight with minimum mode (DIRECT MODE) of the FCS as well as landing above MLW. At 15:26Z the crew set the emergency transponder code. Vapp was determined to be 155 KIAS. the descent on the glideslope was stabilised and without any deviation from Vapp. Descending between 1.100 and 900 feet the crew received 5 cycles of predictive windshear warnings. Descending through 260 feet AGL the aircraft began to deviate below the glide slope. a ‘GLIDESLOPE’ warning occurred. Descending between 180 to 40 feet the engine thrust was increased causing the aircraft to accelerate to 164 knots. At 16 feet AGL the speed was 170 KIAS. A Terrain Awareness Warning System aural signal ‘Retard’ occurred. The engine thrust was reduced to idle. At that point the captain began to apply oscillating pitch inputs with increasing amplitude which changed the pitch angle up to +6 and -2 degrees. The aircraft made a ""three point"" touchdown 900 meters past the runway threshold at 158 KIAS and a vertical load of +2.55G and bounced up to 6 feet AGL. The spoilers did not deploy. In DIRECT MODE they are not permitted to operate automatically and need to be extended manually. however the spoilers were not manually extended by the crew. Two seconds after the first touchdown the aircraft touched down a second time with the nose gear first at 155 KIAS and +5.85G. The aircraft bounced off again to 18 feet AGL. A third touchdown occurred at 140 KIAS in excess of +5G resulting in the destruction of the construction. a fuel spill and fire."

2018,28/Sep,1010,Chuuk. Micronesia,Air Niugini,,Pohnpei - Chuuk,Boeing 737-8BK,P2-PXE,35,12,1,0,0,The aircraft was approaching for a landing at Chuuk/Weno Airport in rain when it landed in a lagoon 500 feet short of the runway. A passenger was found in the plane 3 days after the accident. The flight crew did not comply with Air Niugini Standard Operating Procedures Manual (SOPM) and the approach and pre-landing checklists. The flight crew heard. but disregarded. aural alerts (Glideslope and Sink Rate).
2018,29/Oct,631,Jakarta. Indonesia,Lion Air,610,Jakarta - Pangkal Pinang,Boeing 737-MAX 8,PK-LQP,181,8,181,8,0,The airliner crashed into the Jakarta Sea. 13 minutes after taking off from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. It was on a short 1 hour flight to Pangkal Pinang. After taking off from runway 25L. the aircraft made a climbing left-hand turn after which the crew radioed a request to return too the airport. The aircraft then showed an erratic pattern of flight and began losing altitude until it crashed into the sea. 9 miles off the Jakarta coast. It was reported the plane had problems the night before on a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta. When the 737 Max 8 was designed. it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this. the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this. not the pilots or airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude. it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane. the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude. but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane’s stall speed was reached. and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem.
2018,06/Nov,253,Georgetown. Guyana,Fly Jamaica Airways,,Georgetown - Toronto,Boeing 757-N23,N524AT,120,8,1,0,0,After taking off and reaching FL200. the crew reported a hydraulic problem and circled back to Georgetown Airport.

Contact was lost about 40 minutes after taking off. Before contact was lost. the pilot requested a route change due to weather conditions. Preliminary indications are the plane ran into poor weather and stalled from FL320. The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer. who was flying. became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash. Records show that the plane flew with that mechanical problem for 12 months preceding the accident.
